Chalk
Write it down, get it done.

Do you find yourself overwhelmed with all the things you have to do?
Don't know what to do first? That's alright, neither did we, until we made Chalk.
Introducing Chalk, a webapp that will help you plan and manage your schedule.

Just tell Chalk:
- what you need to get done
- when it has to be done by
- how important it is to you
and Chalk will help you figure out how to go about your week.

Chalk will take care of it, so you don't have to.
